Let your customers buy products before they are released and generate cash flow in advance to cover costs.

== Description ==

With YITH Pre-Order for WooCommerce you can enable a pre-sales system in your shop, increase your customers' interest in soon-to-be-released products and get cash flow in advance to cover the costs of production/promotion.

== How does it work? ==

With this free plugin, you can easily manage the pre-sale of your products and create a marketing strategy similar to that used by large e-commerce stores such as Amazon, Apple, Nike, and Nintendo. Youâ€™ll be able to change the "Add to cart" button label to "Pre-order", set a release date for your products, and send an email notification to your customers when the products they pre-ordered become available in your store.

**Do you want to offer an incentive to push customers to pre-order products?** The winning strategy is to offer a special discount on the price of your products only to those who pre-order them (e.g. "Get $50 off only if you pre-order the new smartphone now!").

= Free version options =

* Select in which products to enable the pre-order mode
* Disable pre-order mode manually or automatically if you select a release/availability date (and time)
* Customize the label and colors of the "Add to cart" button in the "Frequently Bought Together" section
* Set a fixed price for products in pre-order mode (e.g. $100 when pre-order mode is enabled, $120 when it is disabled)
* Apply a discount (or the opposite, increase the product price) when customers purchase a pre-order product
* Charge the product price the moment the customer places the pre-order
* Receive an email as admin when a customer pre-orders a product
* Send an email to customers when they pre-order a product

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin capable of capturing the order only when the product becomes available or does it charge the payment right away? =

In Pre-Order, the payments must be charged at the very moment the order is placed.

= I set a product with no stock as Pre-Order. Why can't it be purchased? =
